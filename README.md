# 🎮 Pixoku

A simple Sudoku game, no ads, no distractions - just Sudoku.

## 🎯 Why Pixoku?

Because my mom was tired of ads in her Sudoku apps.

So I created Pixoku: a free Sudoku app, no ads, no tracking, nothing but the essentials for playing peacefully.

## ✨ Features

- **3 difficulty levels**: Easy, Medium, Hard
- **Notes system**: Mark possibilities in each cell
- **Auto-save**: Resume your game where you left off
- **Statistics**: Track your progress and best times
- **Themes**: 6 color themes to play in the best conditions
- **Smooth animations**: Just enough for nice visual feedback
- **Dark/Light mode**: Play anytime
- **No ads**: Never. Promise.
- **No internet required**: Play wherever you want, whenever you want
